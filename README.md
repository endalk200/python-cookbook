# python-cookbook
A cookbook in the programming context is collection of tiny programs that each demonstrate a particular 
programming concept. The Cookbook Method is the process of learning a programming language by building 
up a repository of small programs that implement specific programming concepts. Starting with a Hello 
World program and building the knowledge piece by piece on top of that.

If you are a beginner, you will probably want to start out with one language like Python and start building 
up your repetoire of snippets for reference and confidence. If you are a seasoned developer, you may want 
to start building a cookbook from scratch for a new language you have never used, or keep a cookbook for
more advanced topics in a language you are already familiar with.
